[Line 0] "The Lottery" (1948) by Shirley Jackson
[Line 1] 
[Line 2] The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers
[Line 3] were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in
[Line 4] the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o'clock; in some towns there were so many
[Line 5] people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 2th. but in this village, where there
[Line 6] were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could begin at ten
[Line 7] o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.
[Line 8] The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of
[Line 9] liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke
[Line 10] into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands.
[Line 11] Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his
[Line 12] example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the
[Line 13] villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the
[Line 14] square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves,
[Line 15] looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.
[Line 16] Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and
[Line 17] taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they
[Line 18] smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after
[Line 19] their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands.
[Line 20] Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came
[Line 21] reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand
[Line 22] and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and
[Line 23] took his place between his father and his oldest brother.
[Line 24] The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween program--by Mr.
[Line 25] Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he
[Line 26] ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him. because he had no children and his wife was a
[Line 27] scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of
[Line 28] conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, Mr.
[Line 29] Graves, followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and
[Line 30] Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between
[Line 31] themselves and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, "Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?"
[Line 32] there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the
[Line 33] box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.
[Line 34] The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the
[Line 35] stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr.
[Line 36] Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as
[Line 37] much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been
[Line 38] made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first
[Line 39] people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking
[Line 40] again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's being done.
[Line 41] The black box grew shabbier each year: by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly
[Line 42] along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.
[Line 43] Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had
[Line 44] stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or
[Line 45] discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood
[Line 46] that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued. had been all very well
[Line 47] when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on
[Line 48] growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into he black box. The night before
[Line 49] the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them in the box, and it was
[Line 50] then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers' coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take
[Line 51] it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put way, sometimes one place, sometimes
[Line 52] another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves's barn and another year underfoot in the post office. and
[Line 53] sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.
[Line 54] There was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were
[Line 55] the lists to make up--of heads of families. heads of households in each family. members of each
[Line 56] household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the
[Line 57] official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort,
[Line 58] performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory. tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each
[Line 59] year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it,
[Line 60] others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this p3rt of the
[Line 61] ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had
[Line 62] had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with
[Line 63] time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr.
[Line 64] Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans. with one hand resting
[Line 65] carelessly on the black box. he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves
[Line 66] and the Martins.
[Line 67] Just as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came
[Line 68] hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the
[Line 69] back of the crowd. "Clean forgot what day it was," she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and
[Line 70] they both laughed softly. "Thought my old man was out back stacking wood," Mrs. Hutchinson went on.
[Line 71] "and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twentyseventh and came
[Line 72] a-running." She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, "You're in time,
[Line 73] though. They're still talking away up there."
[Line 74] Mrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing
[Line 75] near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through
[Line 76] the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through: two or three people said. in voices
[Line 77] just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, "Here comes your, Missus, Hutchinson," and "Bill, she
[Line 78] made it after all." Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said
[Line 79] cheerfully. "Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie." Mrs. Hutchinson said.
[Line 80] grinning, "Wouldn't have me leave m'dishes in the sink, now, would you. Joe?," and soft laughter ran
[Line 81] through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson's arrival.
[Line 82] "Well, now." Mr. Summers said soberly, "guess we better get started, get this over with, so's we can go
[Line 83] back to work. Anybody ain't here?"
[Line 84] "Dunbar." several people said. "Dunbar. Dunbar."
[Line 85] Mr. Summers consulted his list. "Clyde Dunbar." he said. "That's right. He's broke his leg, hasn't he?
[Line 86] Who's drawing for him?"
[Line 87] "Me. I guess," a woman said. and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. "Wife draws for her husband." Mr.
[Line 88] Summers said. "Don't you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?" Although Mr. Summers and
[Line 89] everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the
[Line 90] lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while
[Line 91] Mrs. Dunbar answered.
[Line 92] "Horace's not but sixteen vet." Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. "Guess I gotta fill in for the old man this
[Line 93] year."
[Line 94] "Right." Sr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, "Watson boy
[Line 95] drawing this year?"
[Line 96] A tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. "Here," he said. "I'm drawing for my mother and me." He blinked
[Line 97] his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said thin#s like "Good fellow,
[Line 98] lack." and "Glad to see your mother's got a man to do it."
[Line 99] "Well," Mr. Summers said, "guess that's everyone. Old Man Warner make it?"
[Line 100] "Here," a voice said. and Mr. Summers nodded.
[Line 101] A sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. "All ready?" he
[Line 102] called. "Now, I'll read the names--heads of families first--and the men come up and take a paper out of
[Line 103] the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn.
[Line 104] Everything clear?"
[Line 105] The people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions: most of them were
[Line 106] quiet. wetting their lips. not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, "Adams."
[Line 107] A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. "Hi. Steve." Mr. Summers said. and Mr.
[Line 108] Adams said. "Hi. Joe." They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached
[Line 109] into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went
[Line 110] hastily back to his place in the crowd. where he stood a little apart from his family. not looking down at
[Line 111] his hand.
[Line 112] "Allen." Mr. Summers said. "Anderson.... Bentham."
[Line 113] "Seems like there's no time at all between lotteries any more." Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in the
[Line 114] back row.
[Line 115] "Seems like we got through with the last one only last week."
[Line 116] "Time sure goes fast.-- Mrs. Graves said.
[Line 117] "Clark.... Delacroix"
[Line 118] "There goes my old man." Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.
[Line 119] "Dunbar," Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said.
[Line 120] "Go on. Janey," and another said, "There she goes."
[Line 121] "We're next." Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box,
[Line 122] greeted Mr. Summers gravely and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd
[Line 123] there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hand. turning them over and over nervously
[Line 124] Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.
[Line 125] "Harburt.... Hutchinson."
[Line 126] "Get up there, Bill," Mrs. Hutchinson said. and the people near her laughed.
[Line 127] "Jones."
[Line 128] "They do say," Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, "that over in the north
[Line 129] village they're talking of giving up the lottery."
[Line 130] Old Man Warner snorted. "Pack of crazy fools," he said. "Listening to the young folks, nothing's good
[Line 131] enough for them. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any
[Line 132] more, live hat way for a while. Used to be a saying about 'Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.' First thing
[Line 133] you know, we'd all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There's always been a lottery," he added
[Line 134] petulantly. "Bad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody."
[Line 135] "Some places have already quit lotteries." Mrs. Adams said.
[Line 136] "Nothing but trouble in that," Old Man Warner said stoutly. "Pack of young fools."
[Line 137] "Martin." And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. "Overdyke.... Percy."
[Line 138] "I wish they'd hurry," Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. "I wish they'd hurry."
[Line 139] "They're almost through," her son said.
[Line 140] "You get ready to run tell Dad," Mrs. Dunbar said.
[Line 141] Mr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box.
[Line 142] Then he called, "Warner."
[Line 143] "Seventy-seventh year I been in the lottery," Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd.
[Line 144] "Seventy-seventh time."
[Line 145] "Watson" The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, "Don't be nervous, Jack," and
[Line 146] Mr. Summers said, "Take your time, son."
[Line 147] "Zanini."
[Line 148] After that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers. holding his slip of paper in the
[Line 149] air, said, "All right, fellows." For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened.
[Line 150] Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saving. "Who is it?," "Who's got it?," "Is it the
[Line 151] Dunbars?," "Is it the Watsons?" Then the voices began to say, "It's Hutchinson. It's Bill," "Bill
[Line 152] Hutchinson's got it."
[Line 153] "Go tell your father," Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.
[Line 154] People began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at
[Line 155] the paper in his hand. Suddenly. Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers. "You didn't give him time
[Line 156] enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn't fair!"
[Line 157] "Be a good sport, Tessie." Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, "All of us took the same chance."
[Line 158] "Shut up, Tessie," Bill Hutchinson said.
[Line 159] "Well, everyone," Mr. Summers said, "that was done pretty fast, and now we've got to be hurrying a little
[Line 160] more to get done in time." He consulted his next list. "Bill," he said, "you draw for the Hutchinson
[Line 161] family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?"
[Line 162] "There's Don and Eva," Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. "Make them take their chance!"
[Line 163] "Daughters draw with their husbands' families, Tessie," Mr. Summers said gently. "You know that as
[Line 164] well as anyone else."
[Line 165] "It wasn't fair," Tessie said.
[Line 166] "I guess not, Joe." Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. "My daughter draws with her husband's family; that's
[Line 167] only fair. And I've got no other family except the kids."
[Line 168] "Then, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it's you," Mr. Summers said in explanation, "and as far
[Line 169] as drawing for households is concerned, that's you, too. Right?"
[Line 170] "Right," Bill Hutchinson said.
[Line 171] "How many kids, Bill?" Mr. Summers asked formally.
[Line 172] "Three," Bill Hutchinson said.
[Line 173] "There's Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me."
[Line 174] "All right, then," Mr. Summers said. "Harry, you got their tickets back?"
[Line 175] Mr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. "Put them in the box, then," Mr. Summers directed.
[Line 176] "Take Bill's and put it in."
[Line 177] "I think we ought to start over," Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. "I tell you it wasn't fair.
[Line 178] You didn't give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that."
[Line 179] Mr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box. and he dropped all the papers but those
[Line 180] onto the ground. where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.
[Line 181] "Listen, everybody," Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.
[Line 182] "Ready, Bill?" Mr. Summers asked. and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and
[Line 183] children. nodded.
[Line 184] "Remember," Mr. Summers said. "take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one.
[Line 185] Harry, you help little Dave." Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up
[Line 186] to the box. "Take a paper out of the box, Davy." Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and
[Line 187] laughed. "Take just one paper." Mr. Summers said. "Harry, you hold it for him." Mr. Graves took the
[Line 188] child's hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to
[Line 189] him and looked up at him wonderingly.
[Line 190] "Nancy next," Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went
[Line 191] forward switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box "Bill, Jr.," Mr. Summers said, and Billy,
[Line 192] his face red and his feet overlarge, near knocked the box over as he got a paper out. "Tessie," Mr.
[Line 193] Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly. and then set her lips and went up to
[Line 194] the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.
[Line 195] "Bill," Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand
[Line 196] out at last with the slip of paper in it.
[Line 197] The crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, "I hope it's not Nancy," and the sound of the whisper reached the
[Line 198] edges of the crowd.
[Line 199] "It's not the way it used to be." Old Man Warner said clearly. "People ain't the way they used to be."
[Line 200] "All right," Mr. Summers said. "Open the papers. Harry, you open little Dave's."
[Line 201] Mr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and
[Line 202] everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill. Jr.. opened theirs at the same time. and both
[Line 203] beamed and laughed. turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.
[Line 204] "Tessie," Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and
[Line 205] Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.
[Line 206] "It's Tessie," Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. "Show us her paper. Bill."
[Line 207] Bill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on
[Line 208] it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal company
[Line 209] office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.
[Line 210] "All right, folks." Mr. Summers said. "Let's finish quickly."
[Line 211] Although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to
[Line 212] use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with
[Line 213] the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to
[Line 214] pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. "Come on," she said. "Hurry up."
[Line 215] Mr. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said. gasping for breath. "I can't run at all. You'll
[Line 216] have to go ahead and I'll catch up with you."
[Line 217] The children had stones already. And someone gave little Davy Hutchinson few pebbles.
[Line 218] Tessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as
[Line 219] the villagers moved in on her. "It isn't fair," she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head. Old Man
[Line 220] Warner was saying, "Come on, come on, everyone." Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of
[Line 221] villagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him.
[Line 222] "It isn't fair, it isn't right," Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.

[Line 0] "The Lottery" (1948) by Shirley Jackson
[Line 1] 
[Line 2] The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers
[Line 3] were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in
[Line 4] the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o'clock; in some towns there were so many
[Line 5] people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 2th. but in this village, where there
[Line 6] were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could begin at ten
[Line 7] o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.
[Line 8] The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of
[Line 9] liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke
[Line 10] into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands.
[Line 11] Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his
[Line 12] example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the
[Line 13] villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the
[Line 14] square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves,
[Line 15] looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.
[Line 16] Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and
[Line 17] taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they
[Line 18] smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after
[Line 19] their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands.
[Line 20] Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came
[Line 21] reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand
[Line 22] and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and
[Line 23] took his place between his father and his oldest brother.
[Line 24] The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween program--by Mr.
[Line 25] Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he
